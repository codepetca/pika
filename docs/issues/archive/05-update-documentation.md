## Problem

The documentation in `docs/core/roadmap.md` and other files is out of sync with the codebase. Recent features like Classrooms and Assignments have been merged but are not fully reflected in the roadmap or status docs.

## Required Updates

### 1. Update `docs/core/roadmap.md`
- [ ] Add "Classrooms System" to completed phases.
- [ ] Add "Assignments System" to completed phases.
- [ ] Update "Future Features" section (remove implemented items).
- [ ] Update "Current Status" to reflect new capabilities.

### 2. Update `docs/core/design.md`
- [ ] Add "Classrooms" to Key Architectural Patterns if needed.
- [ ] Update Directory Structure to include new API routes and components.

### 3. Review `docs/guidance/assignments.md`
- [ ] Verify if implementation matches the guidance.
- [ ] Update or archive if fully implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Roadmap accurately reflects the current state of the project.
- [ ] Design docs include new architectural elements.
- [ ] Documentation is consistent with the code in `main`.

## Priority

**P2 - Medium** - Good housekeeping to prevent doc-code drift.
