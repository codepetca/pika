## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

**CRITICAL**: Read documentation in this exact order before modifying code:

1. Read [docs/core/design.md](docs/core/design.md) for architectural patterns
2. Read [docs/core/agents.md](docs/core/agents.md) for agent instructions and TDD workflow
3. Read [docs/core/tests.md](docs/core/tests.md) for testing requirements
4. Check [docs/core/roadmap.md](docs/core/roadmap.md) for current implementation status
5. Consult relevant files in [docs/guidance/](docs/guidance/) for feature specs
6. Follow [docs/workflow/handle-issue.md](docs/workflow/handle-issue.md) for issue-based work

This reading order prevents architectural drift and ensures consistency.
